# Contributing to KAITITU

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We appreciate all contributions, from reporting bugs to implementing new features and bug fixes.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is, the more likely it is to be fixed. Before creating a bug report, please check that your bug has not already been reported, and that your bug exists on the latest version of KAITITU. If you find a closed issue that seems to report the same bug you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in your issue description.

You can suggest an enhancement by opening a new *enhancement issue*. Before creating an enhancement, please check that a similar issue does not already exist. Describe the behavior you want and why, and provide examples of how use it in KAITITU.

## Contributing to the codebase

Pick an issue by going through the issue tracker and finding an issue you would like to work on, feel free to pick any issue that is not already assigned. Once youâ€™ve found an interesting issue, assign the issue to yourself, so nobody else duplicates the work on it.
